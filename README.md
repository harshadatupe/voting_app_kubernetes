## Voting App Kubernetes
Deployed containerized voting application on Kubernetes."
Voting application provides interface for a user to vote and show the results of voting.
This voting application is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page

and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster.
